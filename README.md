# Teenage Engineering OP-XY Drum Preset Utility

This script is a proof of concept designed to facilitate the creation and convertion (from OP-1 and OP-1 Field) of drum sampler patches for the Teenage Engineering OP-XY

## Features

1. **Convert OP-1 Drum Patches**:
   - Extracts individual samples from `.aif` drum patch files.
   - Generates a `.preset` folder containing the audio samples and metadata.

2. **Create New Presets**:
   - Creates a new OP-XY drum preset from a folder of `.wav` files.
   - Supports assigning samples to keys based on a standard OP-1 drum layout or a numerical ordering.

## Usage

```bash
python script.py <convert|create> <path> [--layout=<standard|number>]
```

### Commands

- **convert**: Extracts samples and metadata from an existing `.aif` OP-1 drum patch.
- **create**: Creates a new drum preset from a folder of `.wav` files.

### Options

- `<path>`: The file path to the `.aif` file (for `convert`) or the folder containing `.wav` files (for `create`).
- `--layout`: Specifies how samples should be assigned to keys. Options:
  - `standard` (default): Assigns samples based on keywords in filenames to match the OP-1 drum layout.
  - `number`: Assigns samples based on numerical ordering or alphabetical sorting.

## Standard OP-1 Drum Layout

When using the `standard` layout, the script attempts to match `.wav` file names to the following key assignments:

| Key | Assignment         | Keywords                         |
|-----|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1   | Kick               | `kick`                          |
| 2   | Kick               | `kick`                          |
| 3   | Snare              | `snare`                         |
| 4   | Snare              | `snare`                         |
| 5   | Rimshot/Rim        | `rimshot`, `rim`                |
| 6   | Clap and Hand      | `clap`, `hand`                  |
| 7   | Tambourine/Shaker  | `tambourine`, `shaker`          |
| 9   | Closed Hi-Hat      | `hihat`, `hi-hat`, `closed`     |
| 11  | Open Hi-Hat        | `hihat`, `hi-hat`, `open`       |
| 14  | Ride Cymbal        | `ride`, `cymbal`                |
| 16  | Crash Cymbal       | `crash`, `cymbal`               |
| 20â€“24 | Bass              | `bass`                          |

### Notes on File Matching

- Files are assigned to keys based on keywords in their names.
- Keywords containing multiple terms (e.g., `clap` and `hand`) require both terms to be present in the filename.
- If multiple matches exist, files with more specific matches are preferred.
- Any unused files are assigned to remaining empty key slots.

## Example Commands

### Convert an OP-1 Drum Patch

```bash
python script.py convert path/to/drum_patch.aif
```

This will extract individual samples from the `.aif` file and save them in a `.preset` folder.

### Create a New Preset

#### Using Standard Layout

```bash
python script.py create path/to/samples --layout=standard
```

This will assign `.wav` files to keys based on the OP-1 drum layout.

#### Using Number Layout

```bash
python script.py create path/to/samples --layout=number
```

This will assign `.wav` files to keys numerically or alphabetically.

## Output

- For both commands, a folder named `<base_name>.preset` is created in the same directory as the input file or folder.
- The folder contains:
  - Individual `.wav` files (for `convert`) or copies of input `.wav` files (for `create`).
  - A `patch.json` file containing metadata for the OP-1 drum preset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `pydub` library
- `ffmpeg` or `libav` installed and configured
